## Project 3: Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation
### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs). `functions.R` contains functions for transforming data, creating similarity weight matrices and prediction matrices, and evaluating prediction matrices.

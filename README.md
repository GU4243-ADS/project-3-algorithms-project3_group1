## Project 3: Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation

+ Term: Spring 2018
+ Project title: Implementation and Evaluation of Collaborative Filtering Algorithms
+ Team Number: Group 1
+ Team Members: Mingkai Deng, Mao Guan, Ayano Kase, Juho Ma, Cindy Xu
+ Project summary: In this project, we implemented and evaluated different collaborative filtering algorithms of two types: memory-based and model-based. For memory-based model, we also considered possible variations in implementation, with varying methods of weighting (significance and variance weighting) and correlation/similarity measures (Pearson, Spearman, Vector Similarity, Entropy, Mean Squared Difference, and SimRank).
